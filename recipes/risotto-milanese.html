    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>Risotto alla Milanese is a creamy dish made with Arborio rice thatâ€™s gently cooked in beef stock and wine and finished with Parmigiano Reggiano, butter, parsley, and saffron. 
    <br>This risotto makes the perfect side to a wide variety of meat, but goes especially well with braised dishes like Osso Buco.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (400g) Arborio rice or Carnaroli or Vialone Nano</li>
            <li>  8 cups (1.9kg) low-sodium beef stock can also sub chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>    3/4 cup (180g) dry white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter divided</li>
            <li>1 large shallot finely diced</li>
            <li>1 cup (90g) grated Parmigiano Reggiano plus more for serving</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced flat-leaf Italian parsley</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>For the saffron mixture</h3>
       
        <ul><li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
            <li>1/2 cup (120g) warm low-sodium beef stock</li>
        </ul>
            
    <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, heat the beef stock and bring to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, preferably nonstick, pan to medium heat with 3 tablespoons of butter. Add the shallot and saute until soft (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir frequently while continuing to cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the rice turns a bit translucent at the edges.</li>
            <li>Add the wine to the pan and turn the heat to high. Reduce the wine by half (about 2-3 minutes) then turn the heat down to a low simmer.</li>
            <li>Add a 1/2 cup of the stock at a time and stir frequently. As the liquid evaporates, add another 1/2 cup of stock.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process, cooking at a low to medium simmer, 
                <br>until the risotto is al dente and creamy, but not overcooked (should take about 20 minutes). You might not need to use all of the stock.</li>
            <li>Approximately 5 minutes before the risotto has finished, mix a 1/2 cup of warm beef stock with the saffron.</li>
            <li>When satisfied with the consistency, remove the risotto from the heat and add the saffron mixture. Mix well then add the butter, 
                <br>grated cheese, and parsley. Taste test, and season well with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
            
        </ol>
