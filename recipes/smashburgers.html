    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and roll up your sleeves when you sink your teeth into the crispy crust and juicy meat of the Ultimate Smashburger Recipe. 
        <br>Piled high with a hug of molten cheese and sweet onions, this is a classic youâ€™ll be grilling up all summer long.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lbs ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese</li>
        <li>mayonnaise</li>
        <li>pickles</li>
        <li>burger buns</li>
        <li>onion spread or caramelized onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 4 5" pieces of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to 400 degrees. Place a cast iron skillet on direct heat or a griddle and allow it to heat up.</li>
        <li>Divide your meat into 4 and them form 4 balls of meat.</li>
        <li>Mix together your salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the oil to the hot cast iron and allow it to heat.</li>
        <li>Place a ball of meat on the hot skillet and then place a piece of wax paper over the top. Use your spatula or burger press to flatten it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the top.</li>
        <li>Proceed with the remaining balls of meat, careful not to crowd the pan. You can work in batches if needed.</li>
        <li>Let the first side cook for 2 minutes or until it's sizzling and brown.</li>
        <li>Flip your burgers and top with cheese.</li>
        <li>Let the second side cook until brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>To assemble your burgers spread mayo over the bottom bun. Top with pickles. Add 1-2 burger patties on top and then spread the caramelized onions over it. 
            <br>Top with the top bun and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
